 # Learning-React
 This repository contains my react work while I am trying to learn React.
 
 ## What is React?
 React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces created by Facebook. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components” which are reusable. 
 Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.


 ## Challenges 
 I have completed various challenges of creating simple UI functionalities while learning React.

 ### Challenge-1
 - Create a react app from scratch
 - List your favorite Netflix series in the form of an Ordered List

 ### Challenge-2
 The UI should print the current date and current time dynamically
